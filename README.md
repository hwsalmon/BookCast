## Why BookCast?

Most audiobook apps are built around a store or subscription. BookCast is different:

- You keep full control of your files  
- The app is optimized for long-form listening  
- Your data stays on your device  

If you already manage your own audiobook files (e.g., ripped CDs, DRM-free purchases, personal recordings), BookCast gives you a dedicated player built around that use case.

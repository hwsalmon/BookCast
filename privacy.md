# BookCast – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 11-30-2025_

BookCast is an iOS application designed to play DRM-free audiobooks that you provide yourself. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection

BookCast does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information on external servers.

The app:

- Does **not** require you to create an account  
- Does **not** collect your name, email address, or contact information  
- Does **not** track your listening history on external servers  
- Does **not** include third-party analytics or advertising SDKs  

All information used by the app to function is stored locally on your device.

## 2. Audiobook Files and Library

Your audiobook files are your own content.

- BookCast reads and plays audiobook files that you choose to add  
- These files remain on your device and are not uploaded by BookCast  
- The app may store local metadata (e.g., playback position, title, cover art) on the device to provide its core functionality

BookCast does not upload your files or library information to any external service.

## 3. Device and Usage Data

By default, BookCast does not send usage or analytics data to the developer.

However, Apple may collect anonymized diagnostic information if you have enabled “Share iPhone & Watch Analytics” or similar system-level settings. This data is governed by Apple’s own privacy policy and is not directly controlled by the BookCast app.

## 4. Third-Party Services

BookCast does not integrate third-party advertising SDKs or external analytics frameworks.

If, in the future, additional third-party services are added (for example, optional analytics or integrations), this Privacy Policy will be updated to describe:

- What is collected  
- How it is used  
- How you can opt out, where applicable  

## 5. Children’s Privacy

BookCast is not specifically directed at children. The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Because BookCast does not collect personal data from users, it does not knowingly store information in a way that can be tied back to individual children.

## 6. Your Choices

You can:

- Remove audiobook files from the app at any time  
- Delete the app from your device, which will remove all data stored locally by BookCast

Because no personal data is collected or stored on external servers, there is no cloud-stored account or data to delete.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally to reflect changes in the app or in legal requirements.

When the policy changes, the “Last updated” date at the top of this page will be revised. Material changes will be highlighted in the app release notes where appropriate.
